# NoSpider-Fabric
Remove Spiders, Cave Spiders and their belongings completely from Minecraft.  
For those who suffering from arachnophobic like me.

## Features
### Blocked Entities
- Spider (entity.minecraft.spider)
- Cave Spider (entity.minecraft.cave_spider)
- Silver Fish (entity.minecraft.silverfish)

### Blocked Blocks
- Cobweb (minecraft:cobweb)

### TODO
- [x] Block entity rendering (client only*)
- [x] Block entity load (client/server)
- [x] Block world generate entity spawner (client/server)
- [ ] Block world generate blocks
- [ ] Move Spider belongings to other mob
- [ ] Configurable blacklist

* `Client only` means the feature only works on client side,   
which means it will not work when only installed on server.
